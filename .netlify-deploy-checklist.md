## üöÄ Ready to Deploy
The app is now ready for Netlify deployment. All TypeScript errors resolved and build successful.

## üì± Testing on iPhone
After deployment:
1. Open the app in Safari on iPhone
2. Tap "Share" ‚Üí "Add to Home Screen"
3. Launch from home screen to verify:
   - Theme loads correctly without flash
   - Safe areas respected (notch, home indicator)

   - App fills entire viewport

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note
The build output shows a chunk size warning (1.14 MB JS bundle). This is acceptable for now but consider code-splitting in the future for optimization.
