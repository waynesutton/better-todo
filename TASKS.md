## Implementation Plan

### Current Architecture

The application is built on a modern, real-time architecture:

**Frontend:**

- React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite for fast development and building
- Custom CSS with CSS variables for theming
- Component-based architecture with context for state management

**Backend:**

- Convex for real-time database and backend functions
- File-based routing for API organization
- Automatic type generation for end-to-end type safety
- Search indexes for full-text search

**Key Technical Decisions:**

- Notion-style inline input for better UX
- Markdown support for rich content
- Real-time sync for multi-device use
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Custom confirmation dialogs instead of browser defaults
